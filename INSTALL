1.	INTRODUCTION

To install the TILE forth environment create a directory with the 
name "tile" and move all the "tile.kit" files to the new directory.
The kit files should be packed up with the command "sh". A number
of additional directories will be built. To compile the TILE forth
application issue the command "make". The sequence of commands is:

% mkdir tile
% mv tile.kit.* tile
% cd tile
% sh tile.kit.01
% ...
% { sh tile.man.01 }
% ...
% make

The "make" command will compile the forth environment. You can use
the option "opt" to generate an optimized version. The standard make
file in the source directory assumes that you are using GNU CC. Change
or comment out the compiler definition line if you are using some
other C compiler.


2.	SEARCH PATHS

The compiled forth application will be placed in the "tile/bin"
directory. To gain access to it and the manual pages you should
add the following section to your ".login" file. 

setenv TILE $HOME/tile
set path = ($path $TILE/bin)
#
setenv TILEPATH .:$TILE/lib:$TILE/tst
setenv MANPATH $TILE/man:/usr/share/man


3. 	GNU EMACS FORTH-MODE

The programming environment is a forth-mode for GNU emacs. To make
it available to emacs you must add the following definitions to your
".emacs" file (or load the library "src/forth.el" manually in emacs 
each time).

;; *** Search path for directories to find files to load ***
(set-variable 'load-path (append load-path '(nil "~/tile/scr")))

;; *** TILE forth mode ***
(setq forth-help-load-path '("~/tile/doc"))
(autoload 'forth-mode "forth")
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.tst$" . forth-mode) 
		("\\.f83$" . forth-mode))
	      auto-mode-alist))


Depending on which directory you have used ($HOME or some system 
directory) the directory specification will have to be changed. If
correctly installed emacs will automatically load the forth-mode 
on files with the extensions "f83" and "tst" and start the forth
application in a sub-window. For more information about the
forth-mode just give the command "M-X describe-mode" in emacs.


4.	GNU EMACS HELP FILES

If you have available the manual pages you should issue the following
make command at the top directory (tile):

% make help

This command will process all the manual pages so that they may be
used by the function help command (C-h) in the forth-mode in GNU
Emacs.
